# 😶 Blob.io 😶

My attempt to create the new .io game. Inspired by the game
[Agar.io](https://agar.io/) and The Coding Train's
[Coding Challenge #32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXuxYMGe4KI).

### 🎮 How to play

Eat food. Avoid bigger blobs. Eat smaller blobs. Get bigger and stronger by
power ups. Crash into other blobs. Get to the top of the leaderboard.

### 🕹️ Controls

You only need your mouse to play this game. Move your mouse to move your blob.
